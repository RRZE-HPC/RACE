In this paper we described coloring algorithms and the 
open-source library implementation \acrshort{RACE} for efficient \acrfull{SymmSpMV} on
\CAcomm{modern multicore \sout{manycore}} architectures. Motivated by the shortcomings of existing \acrshort{MC} methods in  terms of hardware efficiency 
and to address node-level performance, we derived a novel recursive algebraic  coloring algorithm 
which eliminates the shortcomings of previously existing coloring methods.
\acrshort{RACE} generates hardware efficient \DK colorings of undirected graphs and puts 
\CAcomm{emphasis \sout{emphazise}} on achieving data locality, load balancing, and sufficient levels of parallelism that matches the 
number of cores  of the underlying architecture. The hardware awareness of the 
coloring method allows \acrshort{RACE} to achieve good data locality, lower synchronization costs and 
improved load-balancing compared to other state-of-the art coloring methods. 
\CAcomm{The two previous sentence can be merged, they tell the same thing.}
We demonstrated this benefit  by comparing  \acrshort{RACE} performance against two different 
\acrshort{MC} methods and \acrshort{MKL} implementations. Futhermore, our entire performance experiments
was backed by a strong performance model,  which ensured us the optimality of the \acrshort{RACE} approach
and threw light into the modern challenges  of the \acrshort{SymmSpMV} kernel.
A comparison with a state-of-the-art library  supplied by the Intel vendor, using 31 sparse matrices 
on the latest Intel  processors, shows that the proposed approach in \acrshort{RACE}
obtains performance very close to the estimated prediction using our derived roofline performance model for 
\acrfull{SymmSpMV}. \acrshort{RACE} fullty takes into account  deep memory hierarchies thus 
\CAcomm{enhancing \sout{hampering}} scalability and full-chip performance.
 We obtained an average speedup of over 1.4 for \acrshort{SymmSpMV} compared to current 
state-of-the-art  coloring algorithm and can achieve speedups of up to 2.




However, similar to any other \acrshort{MC} approaches \acrshort{RACE} method 
is not just limited to the \acrshort{SymmSpMV} kernel
and can be used to efficiently parallelize solvers and kernels 
having general \DK dependencies. Moreover, due to the level-based formulation
of \acrshort{RACE} the framework has an added advantage to address 
other classes of problems. Future work with \acrshort{RACE} will involve the
kernel operations like in-place matrix powers and polynomials, which are of 
high interest in the scientific community.
