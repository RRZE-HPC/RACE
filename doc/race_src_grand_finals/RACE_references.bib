abstract="We shall in this paper consider the problem of computing a generalized solution of a given linear system of equations. The matrix will be partitioned by blocks of rows or blocks of columns. The generalized inverses of the blocks are then used as data to Jacobi- and SOR-types of iterative schemes. It is shown that the methods based on partitioning by rows converge towards the minimum norm solution of a consistent linear system. The column methods converge towards a least squares solution of a given system. For the case with two blocks explicit expressions for the optimal values of the iteration parameters are obtained. Finally an application is given to the linear system that arises from reconstruction of a two-dimensional object by its one-dimensional projections.",

The method is based on a 3-level hybrid parallel programming model, including message passing for inter-SMP node communication, loop directives by OpenMP for intra-SMP node parallelization and vectorization for each processing element (PE). Simple 3D elastic linear problems with more than 8{\texttimes}108 DOF have been solved by 3x3 block ICCG(0) with additive Schwarz domain decomposition and PDJDS/CM-RCM reordering on 128 SMP nodes of Hitachi SR8000/MPP parallel computer, achieving performance of 335.2 GFLOPS. The PDJDS/CM-RCM reordering method provides excellent vector and parallel performance in SMP nodes.",

abstract="Hardware performance monitoring (HPM) is a crucial ingredient of performance analysis tools. While there are interfaces like LIKWID, PAPI or the kernel interface perf{\_}event which provide HPM access with some additional features, many higher level tools combine event counts with results retrieved from other sources like function call traces to derive (semi-)automatic performance advice. However, although HPM is available for x86 systems since the early 90s, only a small subset of the HPM features is used in practice. Performance patterns provide a more comprehensive approach, enabling the identification of various performance-limiting effects. Patterns address issues like bandwidth saturation, load imbalance, non-local data access in ccNUMA systems, or false sharing of cache lines. This work defines HPM event sets that are best suited to identify a selection of performance patterns on the Intel Haswell processor. We validate the chosen event sets for accuracy in order to arrive at a reliable pattern detection mechanism and point out shortcomings that cannot be easily circumvented due to bugs or limitations in the hardware.",
